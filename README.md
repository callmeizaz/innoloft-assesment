## Reflection
This was a 6hr long assesment project built Using ReactJS. 

I have built this intractive dashboard that allowed users to edit projects data. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-6^` and `zustand`.  

Due to project time constraints, I had to table some APIs due no incomplete instructions of Request Parametes to update data and focus more on data visualization from parts of the API that weren't restricted to users.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 6.10.0, Zustand, Tailwind, MUI and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
